Create a class library that implements geofencing to allow users to quickly and easily create local tour app such as Derry Smart Tour arround the world using Xamarin forms

1. Store Coordinates in a way that a programmer can use the class library along with their own data 
2. Determine which location a coordinate is contained in
3. Create a list of locations sorted by their distance frrom a point
4. Create a list of location at a specifed bearing
5. Update a list of current locations and closest locations that are user interface bindable and auto updated as a new coordinate is recieved
6. Provide additional functionality as required that gives more options to the user that extend the protability of the class library

1. Allow to create a list of locations each containing abritary list of GPS coordinates.
1.1 Create a class to hold the gps coordinate and methods required to make calculations(Distance, Bearing, Equality)
1.2 Create a class to hold a range of bearings and determine if a another bearing is within 
1.3 Create abstract class containing the GPS coordinates and methods required to make calculations(Point within polygon, Distance, Bearing range, Closest distance)
1.4 Create a class to hold 2 coordinates that form a bounding box around a location
1.5 Create a class to store a collection of locations and the methods to sort and make iterate through the locations 
2. Determine which location/s if any a specifed GPS corrdinate is within
3. Create a list of locations sorted by distance from a specifed location
4. Create a list of locations that are located in a specified bearing sorted by distance
5. Monitor GPS activity and send events when gps location is within a location






Deferred to future version
1. Add radial and polyline based locations
2. Add support for locations greater than 180degrees logitude
3. Add latitude normalisation and support locations containing poles
4. Implement Vincenty solutions of geodesics on the ellipsoid for more accurate distance calculations https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-vincenty.html
5. Add monitoring of orientation sensor and send events when phone is facing a LocationTrigger
6. Add navigation feature for directions to a location
7. Remove dependancy on Xamarin Essentials and Geolocator
